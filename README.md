# Predicting-rental-duerations

A DVD rental company needs your help! They want to determine how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on certain features and have approached you for help. They want you to try out some regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent a DVD for. The company wants a model which yeilds a MSE of 3 or less on a test set. The model you make will help the company become more efficient in inventory planning.


### The solution was approached by using a voting regressors algorithm to score below 3 MSE as required.
